### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1=74HZ | f1"=54HZ |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2=804HZ | f"=900KHZ |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl =73KHZ \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l =895KHZ \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} =11.12 \) | \( A'{v(mid)} =2.92 \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 7.80 | 2.06 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
